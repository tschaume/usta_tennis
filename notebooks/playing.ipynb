    "    CRD - Computer Rated Differential (numerical value for the difference in score)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    One way to assign a value to a specific score, is to count the number of service breaks\n",
    "    and scale it to a value appropriate for NTRP ratings. For instance, at-level/true 4.5\n",
    "    players should populate the core of the 4.5 interval. Defining the core of a 0.5-wide\n",
    "    interval as its inner 90%, yields the range 4.05 - 4.45. An average upper 4.5 player\n",
    "    would then correspond to a 4.35 rating and a lower 4.5 player to 4.15.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A good scale for the CRD reflects the fact that an upper 4.5 player routinely beats a\n",
    "    lower 4.5 player. A sensible choice for a routine but competitive win is a score of\n",
    "    6-3/6-3 or 6-3/6-2 [see below].\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The number of service breaks in these cases should hence be equivalent to the difference\n",
    "    of 0.2 between an upper and a lower 4.5 player. A 6-3/6-3 win entails 3 service breaks\n",
    "    whereas a 6-3/6-2 win could be counted as 3.5 service breaks. Assigning a scaling factor\n",
    "    of 0.06 for each additional service break is thus a good choice and results in CRDs of\n",
    "    0.18 and 0.21, respectively.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the CRD, the number of service breaks in the third set also counts half since the\n",

    "    \n",

    "    scores at least 4 games in total. If this isn't the case, the outcome of the match would\n",
    "    almost always be a non-competitive score regardless of how often they play each other.\n",
    "    Since neither player probably plays their best due to the non-competitiveness of the match,\n",
    "    the score likely is inaccurate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the worst case of a 6-0/6-0 score, it's tough to assess performance of either player\n",
    "    at all without a game on the scoreboard for the loser. The loser might have been close\n",
    "    to scoring a game in every game of the match or in none at all.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    It hence makes sense to treat 6-0/6-0 scores as outliers in the calculation of ratings\n",
    "    and discard them. But we can use this score to estimate the score inaccuracy of a\n",
    "    non-competitive match. In such a match, the winner scored 6 service breaks, and an\n",
    "    additional game for the loser would correspond to half a service break difference in\n",
    "    the CRD, i.e. 0.03. Say the loser got close to winning one of the winner's 6 service\n",
    "    games. The change in CRD value equivalent to this performance would be 0.03/6 = 0.005.\n",
    "    For non-competitive matches, the CRD is hence adjusted downward by 0.005 to not affect\n",
